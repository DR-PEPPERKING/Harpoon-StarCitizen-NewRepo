// IBackgroundTaskManager runs background tasks in worker thread.
//
// Tasks are derived from IBackgroundTask. Each task is split in two parts for:
//  Work - done in background thread.
//  Finalize - called afterward in main thread to apply results.
//
// Task objects are reference counted. Task manager will hold its own reference to the task object
// for as long as the task is pending or being executed. If you want to keep the task object around
// in your code you will have to call AddRef() and Release() on the task object by yourself so there
// will be an extra reference to the task object held by your code.
//
// Work returns the state of the task. Task can be resumed, then the Work
// method will be called again. Other tasks can work between calls to Work.
// It is possible to Cancel task. Work method is not invoked any more for
// Canceled tasks.
