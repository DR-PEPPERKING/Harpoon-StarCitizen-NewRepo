// helper class to calculated hemisphere accessibility of a 2d graph or more useful for a heightmap (apply the same algo. n times)
// call Insert() 2d point on a graph (x coordiante has to advance for each point
// this method returns the slope at that position (without any noise)
//
// Performance for a line with n points:
//    O_min(n), O_avg(k*n*n) k<1 depending on input, Omax(n*n)
//
// because of the cache locality this is a very fast way to calculate the accessibility
//
// Comparison with simple raycasting (other algorithms are much more complex to code):
//    result is noisy, O_avg(q*n*n), q>8 depending on quality, with more programming you can get cache locality almost like here
