/*
 * Panel with the list of available Graphs
 *
 * There is a fixed structure with folders for the different graph types (UI Actions, Modules, Entity Graphs..).
 * Currently all graphs are FlowGraphs and in fact it's only possible to check the graph type of a FG as HG doesn't have it.
 * Therefore, although this is meant to be a generic panel, it's quite specialized for FG.
 *
 * The Tree is responsible for showing all currently available graphs and their state (has modified changes? is disabled? has an error?)
 * The tree should also update when graphs are added, renamed or removed or change type such as when an entity is converted to a prefab.
 * Selecting a graph on the tree should select it for the all dialog - this is in HyperGraphEditorWnd.cpp
 * Right-clicking on one item (folder or graph) should present a context menu with options. - this is also in HyperGraphEditorWnd.cpp,
 *   although it should be refactored to belong here. CHyperGraphDialog::CreateContextMenu/ProcessMenu
 * The tree allows multiple item selection for bulk operations such as deleting or disabling. This is currently making everything complicated :)
 * 
 * Status: The Tree Ctrl was heavily reviewed in June 2017. The context menu still needs to be reviewed.
 * There should be support for drag and drop to move items between folders and in-place renaming without all the modal dialogs.
 * The ability to pin graphs or to have a tabbed system with open graphs is to be considered. A search for graph name would also be useful.
 * -- Ines 2017
